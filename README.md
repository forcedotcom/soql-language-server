# SOQL Language Server

Provides SOQL language capabilities for text editors, including code-completion and errors checks.
This package implements the server-side of the LSP protocol.

[Salesforce's SOQL VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salesforce.salesforcedx-vscode-soql), which lives in repo [salesforcedx-vscode](https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode), includes an LSP client implementation for this server.

## Development

If you are interested in contributing, please take a look at the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.

- `yarn` from the top-level directory to pull all dependencies
- `yarn build` to build
- `yarn run lint` to run static checks with eslint
- `yarn run test` to run automated tests

This package is used by VS Code extension `salesforcedx-vscode-soql` which lives in repo [salesforcedx-vscode](https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode).

During development, you can work with a local copy of the `salesforcedx-vscode` repo, and configure it to use your local build from your `soql-language-server` repo using yarn/npm links. Example:

```
# Make global links available
cd soql-language-server
yarn link

# Link to them from the VS Code SOQL extension package
cd salesforcedx-vscode
npm install
cd ./packages/salesforcedx-vscode-soql
npm link @salesforce/soql-language-server
```

With that in place, you can make changes to `soql-language-server`, build, and then relaunch the `salesforcedx-vscode` extensions from VS Code to see the changes.

### Debug Jest Test

You can debug Jest test for an individual package by running the corresponding launch configuration in VS Codes _RUN_ panel.
